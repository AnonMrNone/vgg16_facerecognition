Hello World!
In today's data science world having huge amount of data that is called big data, we usually face problems in training and creating model as it requires huge computational power which is not feasible to all. Moreover even if we  have thousands of record of data it is not enough to yield better accuracy. To cope up with this situation one of the best way is to use pre-trained model, here pre-trained model means pre-trained weights and bias or other hyper-parameter like kernel size, pooling, optimizer, learning rate and many more. This helps us in two ways that is:
1. Less computational power or resources like RAM, CPU, GPU or TPU etc.
2. In less quantity of data we can achieve more accuracy.

This concept is called Transfer Learning and Fine Tuning, which I have explained in very detail in my article.
